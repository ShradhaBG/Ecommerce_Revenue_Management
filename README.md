Note to Learners: Avoiding "SyntaxError" in .ipynb Submissions

When submitting .ipynb files for your Python project, please ensure the following:

1. Content Type: Your .ipynb file should primarily contain Python code and Markdown cells for documentation. Avoid mixing HTML or XML content within the notebook.

2. File Integrity: Verify that your .ipynb file opens correctly in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible viewer without any error messages. If you encounter the "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'" message, it means there is non-JSON content in the file.

3. Backup: Always keep a backup of your .ipynb file in case of accidental corruption.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your submissions are in the correct format and will be processed without issues. If you need to include HTML or XML content, consider using Markdown cells for documentation instead.
